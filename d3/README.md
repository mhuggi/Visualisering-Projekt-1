Creating data-driven visualizations and infographics that run on multiple devices responsively is a tough challenge. The D3.js library has revolutionized visualization by making it easier to parse your data and add meaningful interactivity. You can bring your data to life using D3, a bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and some SVG graphics. In this course, senior staff author Ray Villalobos explores how the D3 library works, and how you can use it to parse data from different sources and create interactive, visually exciting infographics and visualizations. He reviews the basics—controlling HTML with jQuery-esque selections and modifying attributes through CSS—before moving on to working with SVG graphics, a top choice for graphics in D3 visualizations. He also covers working with D3 methods like scaling, events, transitions, and animations, as well as how to work with data, including connecting to external data sources.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage. Or you can simply add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at. 

## Branches
The branches are structured so that they correspond to the videos in the course. So, for example if I name a branch `02_03b` then that branch corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The extra letter at the end of the name corresponds to the state of the branch. A `b` means that this is how the code looks at the beginning of the video, an `e` means that is how the code looked at the end of the video.

You may find additional branches that correspond to other states, so for example, you may see a `t`, which means this is a target branch. A target branch is something I use during development or updates of a course and it's for a branch that I'm working towards. For the purposes of taking a course, you may ignore any additional branches. The `master` branch usually has the state of the project as I'm working through it and the final state of the code when I finish the course. 

## Installing
